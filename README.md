A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database and an entirely themed persona to make Chika suitable for Anime and Manga group chats. 

The Support group can be reached out to at [Chika Support](https://t.me/OkaeriUserbot), where you can ask for help about discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available. 

News channel as at [Chika Updates](https://t.me/nbzoning)

## How to setup/deploy.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Edit any mentions of @OkaeriUserbot to your own support chat. 
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats.

  ## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older Python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which is ordered by default in 3.6.

  ### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.

The preferred version is to use a `config.py` file, as it makes it easier to see all your settings grouped together.
This file should be placed in your `ChikaRobot` folder, alongside the `__main__.py` file. 
This is where your bot token will be loaded from, as well as your database URI (if you're using a database), and most of 
your other settings.

It is recommended to import sample_config and extend the Config class, as this will ensure your config contains all 
defaults set in the sample_config, hence making it easier to upgrade.

  ### Python dependencies

 ```
- Install the necessary Python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
- This will install all the necessary python packages.
```
